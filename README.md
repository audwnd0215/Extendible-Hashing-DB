Extendible Hashing DB (EHDB)
========================
EHDB is a simple database that supports insertion and query. It implements the extendible hashing algorithm and the Least Recently Used cache algorithm by C++. I use a approximately 700 MB file (TPC-H lineitem.tbl) to test its functionality.

This is the project of Database course (2012 Spring Semester).
